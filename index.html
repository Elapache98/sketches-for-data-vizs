    <h3>Sketch 1 Hypothesis: Youtube, the weather and my mood</h3>
    <p>This was inspired from two weeks ago when we experienced some weather that made it more delightful to be outside.
        From the proposed sketch, I wanted to find how the weather affected my mood and Youtube consumption. So in
        simpler terms,<b>"As the temperature increases, does my Youtube consumption decrease? Another way to also look
            at
            it is, Is my Youtube consumption dependent on the temperature and my mood?"</b> This would be tracked my
        recording
        my daily mood and Youtube consumption as well as the average temperature on each day of the data collection
        duration.

    <h3>Sketch 2 Hypothesis: Emotional love affair with Manchester United's form and my happiness</h3>
    <p>Being a Manchester United fan for more than 10 years now, it's an understatment to say their performances over
        season don't have a direct correlation to my mood. I am intersted in seeing how their form over multiple weeks
        affects both my mood and my Youtube consumption. I will be tracking days where Manchester United don't play,
        when they play and whetehr the win, lose, or draw. Within those days I will also be tracking my mood and the
        amount of time I spend on Youtube. With the dataset that will be yielded I hope to see if I'm generally happy
        only on days when Manchester United wins a game and how that generally correlates to my Youtube consumption. So
        essentially, <b>am I happier when I spend more time on Youtube and does my happiness generally come from when
            Manchester United win a game?</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Sketch 3 Hypothesis: Does productivity and happiness increase on days I work out and talk to friends? </h3>
    <p>This was on of my "creative explorations" but essentially it tracking the duration of activities during the day
        and my mood whilst I perform these activities. The main events I would be tracking are when I perform physical
        activity, commuting, school/work, youtube consumption, when I talk to friends. Productivity would be based on
        the time spent doing work/school related stuff. Since I don't have a rigid schedule for when I choose to be
        productive it would be interesting to track my activites each day and my mood to see what series of activities
        generally leads to me being more productive and happy. So essentially <b>am I more productive when I work out,
            and spend time on Youtube before doing work or am I more productive when I do work first and play later?</b>
        This would provide more insights as to how to schedule my activities per day to optimize peak productivity.
